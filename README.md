# manim-journey-begins
Starting my manim journey(github journey as well) by plotting the motion of the two masses in coupled oscillator system.

> The video above shows a coupled oscillator beat animation generated with Manim.

## ðŸ§® Project Overview

This repository contains my Manim and Python code to animate and visualize the physics of **coupled oscillators**.

- **Animation:** Shows postion as a function of time, "beating" between two masses connected by springs.
